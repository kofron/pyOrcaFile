This is (or eventually will be) a set of utilities for quickly 
accessing ORCA data file metadata. 

Why is this useful?  Because sometimes all you care about is the
metadata.  Your processing pipeline needs to 
know, for example, what the livetime of the run is, or if a 
particular bit is masked in.  Why parse the entire file?

For a quick example check check_livetime.py
