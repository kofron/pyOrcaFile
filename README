This is (or eventually will be) a set of utilities for quickly 
accessing ORCA data file metadata. 

Why is this useful?  Because sometimes all you care about is the
metadata - at least, for now.  Your processing pipeline needs to 
know, for example, what the livetime of the run is, or if a 
particular bit is masked in.  Why parse the entire file?
